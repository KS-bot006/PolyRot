# PolyRot-The Power the Rot Cipher in the Palm Of Your Hand.

PolyRot is your ultimate gateway to access the power of theRot cipher at its finest.




## Getting the basics right:

So, what is the Rot Cipher? For starters, Rot means rotation.
And in case of messages, or strings, we rotate the letters of the message by "n" times.

So, here's a basic example of how it works.

Let us say, I have a message I want to cipher, before sending it to a friend.

So, my message is ```Hello!```
Now, I have to pick a Rot value. Say, 1.
Now we take my message, and shift each letter of the message/string by one letter to the right.
So ```Hello!```, becomes ```Ifmmp!```.
Punctuations and numbers don't change when doing a Rot. 


## About PolyRot

So, Here's where PolyRot comes in. Previously, we understood how the Rot Cipher works by ciphering the word ```Hello!``` using ```Rot-1```.
But doing it for a whole sentence or anything longer is hard and tedious, and working with a Rot-n complicates things further.

Hence PolyRot was born. With a modern, sleek and easy to use interface, PolyRot lets you harness the power of the Rot Cipher with ease.
