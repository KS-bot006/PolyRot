# PolyRot-The Power the Rot Cipher in the Palm Of Your Hand.

## PolyRot is your ultimate gateway to access the power of the Rot cipher at its finest.




## Getting the basics right:

So, what is the Rot Cipher? For starters, Rot means rotation.
And in case of messages, or strings, we rotate each letter of the message by "n" times, where "n" is an integer.

So, here's a basic example of how it works.

Let us say, I have a message that I want to cipher before sending it to a friend.

Say my message is ```Hello!```
Now, I have to pick a Rot value. Say, 1.
Now we take my message, and shift each letter of the message/string by one letter to the right in the alphabet. If there's a ```"z"```, we come back to an ```a```.
Therefore ```Hello!```, becomes ```Ifmmp!```.
Punctuations and numbers don't change when doing a Rot. 

Deciphering a message is the same process, but done backwards.
## About PolyRot

So, Here's where PolyRot comes in. Previously, we understood how the Rot Cipher works by ciphering the word ```Hello!``` using ```Rot-1```.
But doing it for a whole sentence or anything longer is hard and tedious, and working with a Rot-n complicates things further.

Hence PolyRot was born. With a modern, sleek and easy to use interface, PolyRot lets you harness the power of the Rot Cipher with ease.

## Screenshots
For those who wanna take at a look at it before downloading, here's a sneak-peek of what the UI looks like.
This is only the Opening Page.....download it, and there's more UI goodness to experience ;-)

## Installation

Installing PolyRot is very easy. There's a zip file named PolyRot.zip in the releases section (https://github.com/KS-bot006/PolyRot/releases/tag/v1.0.0), that contains executable binaries of the app. All you have to do, is download it and extract it. In it will be a binary named PolyRot.exe, which when executed, launches PolyRot.

### NOTE: Executable binaries for linux coming soon!!
